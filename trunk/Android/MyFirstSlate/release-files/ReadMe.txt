Certificate expires on Mon May 28 14:50:54 SGT 2040.
The Certificate expires in 25 years.
Make sure the certificate is valid for the planned lifetime of the product.
If the certificate expires, you will be forced to sign your application with a different one.
Applications cannot be upgraded if their certificate changes from one version to another, forcing a full uninstall/install, which will make the user lose his/her data.
Google Play(Android Market) currently requires certificates to be valid until 2033.
